# 🚀 The Agentic Shift: Infrastructure for the AI Native Era

## 🔄 From Orchestration to Native Execution

### 🧠 AI Native Apps

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Standard
    H1[Human] <-->|Chat| C[Bot]
    end

    subgraph AI_Native
    H2[Human] -->|Goal| A[Agent]
    A <-->|IO| Sys[System/CLI]
    end

    Standard -.->|Shift| AI_Native
    style A fill:#bbf
```

That's one of the fastest growing areas in AI, with a 60% CAGR, but still only represents (3%) of AI's revenue.

```mermaid
pie title AI Revenue Share vs Growth Potential
    "Traditional AI Revenue" : 97
    "AI Native (60% CAGR)" : 3
```

```mermaid
graph LR
    2023[2023: Niche] --> 2024[2024: Adoption]
    2024 --> 2025[2025: Explosion]

## 📈 Unexpected Success & The Tooling Gap

But AI native tools are an unexpected success.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Hype[Market Hype] -->|Expects| Slow[Gradual]
    Real[Reality] -->|Shows| Exp[Explosive Demand]
    Exp -.->|Surpasses| Slow
    style Exp fill:#f96
```

And it means that we don't have any custom tools for it yet.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Dev[Developer] --> Tools{Legacy Tools}
    Tools -->|IDE/CI/CD| Legacy[Web-First Tools]
    Legacy --> Fail[Mismatch for Agents]
    style Fail fill:#f00,color:#fff
```

## 🛠️ The Integration vs. Creation Dilemma

Current products like langchain, promptfoo, AI sdks are focused on integrating AI into application, not creating AI native tools.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Integration
    App -->|Uses| SDK --> LLM
    end

    subgraph AI_Native
    Agent[AI is the App] -->|Controls| Runtime
    Agent -->|Manages| State
    end

    Integration -.->|Shift| AI_Native
    style Agent fill:#bfb
```

## ☁️ The Infrastructure Shift

AI native applications need to have a machine to live, time to learn, file systems to interact. And it completely changes the way we interact with AI and cloud services.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Core((AI Native App)) <-->|IO| FS[FileSystem]
    Core <-->|Uses| Time[Compute]
    Core <-->|Lives| Env[VM/Container]
    Cloud[Legacy Cloud] -.->|Shift| New[Agentic Cloud]
    New --> Core
```

## 🚧 Current Pain Points

Random processes, lack of version control, memory management, distribution are only a few of the problems that we need to face today.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Prob[Pain Points] -->|No| Random[Control]
    Prob -->|No| Ver[Version Ctrl]
    Prob -->|Yes| Leaks[Context Leaks]
    Prob -->|Yes| Dist[Dist. Hell]

    Random & Ver & Leaks & Dist --> Fail((Failure))
    style Fail fill:#ff9999
```

## 🔓 Unlocking True Productivity

It ends up costing a lot of money, time and efficiency. Real AI productivity will only be unlocked when we have the proper infrastructure and tools to deal with that.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Cur[High Cost + Time] -->|Causes| Block[Blocked Prod.]
    Infra[New Infra] -->|Unlocks| True[True AI Prod.]
    True -->|Result| Agents[Scalable Agents]

    style True fill:#9f9
    style Block fill:#ccc
```

## ⚡ Introducing CLI use: The Ecosystem

And that's what I'm building at CLI use. Tools for creation, management, refining and deployment of these applications.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Logo((CLI use))
    Logo --> Create[Creation]
    Logo --> Manage[Management]
    Logo --> Refine[Refining]
    Logo --> Deploy[Deployment]

    Create & Manage & Refine & Deploy --> Ecosystem[Full Lifecycle Support]
```

## ⏳ The Perfect Timing

I'm building it to solve my personal problems, and trust me, there's an infinite amount of work to do. People have not yet seen what AI is capable of and we're in a perfect timing for it.
