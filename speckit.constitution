# Speckit Constitution: CLI-USE

## 1. Core Philosophy: The "Theater" Principle
*   **Visuals over Logic:** The primary goal of `cli-use` is to demonstrate *what is possible* in a terminal user interface (TUI). We prioritize high-fidelity visuals, smooth animations, and polished layouts over complex backend logic.
*   **Demo-First:** Every feature and component must be showcase-ready. If it doesn't look good or feel responsive, it doesn't belong in `cli-use`.
*   **Mock Everything:** Backend calls, database queries, and heavy computations are simulated. Use `setTimeout` and mocked data (static JSON or procedural generation) to mimic latency and data loading. The UI should never "hang" on a real network request or unexpected system behavior.
*   **Immersive Experience:** The user should feel like they are using a real, powerful tool, even if the underlying actions are simulated.

## 2. Technology Standards (Ink Ecosystem)
*   **Framework:** All terminals are built strictly using `React` and `Ink`.
*   **Interaction:** Use established, stable libraries for user input to ensure a robust experience:
    *   `ink-text-input` for text fields and command prompts.
    *   `ink-select-input` for menus, dropdowns, and selection lists.
    *   `ink-spinner` or custom animations for loading states.
*   **Styling:** 
    *   Use `Box` (Flexbox) for all layouts. 
    *   Avoid absolute positioning unless necessary for overlays or specific visual effects.
    *   Utilize `chalk` (or similar) for consistent color theming (e.g., standard success/error colors).

## 3. Architecture & Distribution
*   **Gallery Structure:** 
    *   Demos and example terminals reside in `src/examples/`.
    *   Each demo must be self-contained and exportable.
*   **Unified Entry:** All demos must be accessible via the main `cli-use` binary (e.g., `cli-use run <demo-name>` or a main menu selection).
*   **Shared Components:** Reusable UI elements (Headers, Borders, Logos, Input wrappers) live in `src/components/` to maintain visual consistency and reduce code duplication across different demos.

## 4. Development Workflow
*   **Typescript Only:** Strict typing is enforced. Demos serve as educational examples, so code quality and type safety are paramount.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Demos must work on standard terminals across operating systems (macOS, Linux, Windows). Avoid OS-specific shell commands unless wrapped in a safe fallback or mock.
*   **Clean Code:** Follow the project's linting and formatting rules (`eslint`, `prettier`).

## 5. npm Package: `cli-use`
*   **Public Availability:** The project is shared as the npm package `cli-use`.
*   **Ease of Use:** Users should be able to run `npx cli-use` (or installed globally) and immediately see the demo content without complex setup.
