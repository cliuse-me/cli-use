A bit more about you
What is the most impressive thing you have ever done? (500 characters)
Describe what was it, your role, and impact.
Got my first PERSONAL computer (i had access to shared) at 15. 
I sold my first company at 17, in the SEO space. 
Basically we hacked google's algorithm and made money from ads. During 2016-2019 we could make 10 m monthly views. I took care of the engineering, devops and bot automation for the entire project and, at the same time, was responsible for an copywritting team.

Tell us about what you're building

What's your thesis? (up to 500 chars)
The problem you're obsessed with and how you're thinking about solving it.
Problem:
AI native applications are taking over, yet they don't yet have any specific custom built infra. tools. Lack of proper tools makes dealing with long-running coding agents (Clawde Bot, Moltbot, Claude Code) less reliable, local, random and expensive. It blocks application's full potential.

Solution:
Enable builders to verify, package, version-control and distribute their agents properly. 

Product:
Infra-layer for AI native apps

{
Vercel => frontend
This => AI Native apps=[Open claw]
}
The problem you're obsessed with and how you're thinking about solving it.
Why are you the right person to build this? (up to 500 chars)
Lived experience, work background, obsession. What makes you dangerous in this space.
1-I ship very fast and with quality.

2)
-I care for the customer and the problem (specially because me and my friends are the ICP.

-I do have this problem[It is way bigger and meaningful than it looks]).

3-I've been studying and testing ways to solve this problem for almost a year. In scenario where everything is new, that's a lot.
Lived experience, work background, obsession. What makes you dangerous in this space.
What have you done in the last 30 days to make progress? (up to 300 chars)
Conversations, experiments, launches. Be specific.
Been working on it as an internal tool for a year. Building "market" solutions for less than a week. What I already have: live website, demo, open source package, repo, helping friends to enhance their AI agentic apps. Currently working on code/infra solutions (Their and mine biggest pain). Crafting tutorials that will go to youtube. Contributing to the biggest open source lib for this purpose (used by Claude Code, Gemini, Canva - https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink)
Conversations, experiments, launches. Be specific.
