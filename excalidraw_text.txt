1. And AI doesn't seem to
be even close to completly create
a complex, scalable application

2. The reason for this is context

3. Bigger the application more context it
has.

4. But what if the future of software is 
being simpler, smaller and replacable?

5. That's what i'm trying to solve with CLI use

6. shipping via terminal allows you to get rid
of a ton of unecessary boilerplate, making 
everything simpler

7. Not only this, but it unlock true 
AI native experience.

8. Giving a machine for your agents allow them
to learn, evolve and harness computer resources
entirelly.

9. Instead of spamming them for a short live cycle, 
you allow them 
to have a full life

10. And that's why applications like Clawde
bot, open claw and Claude code are taking
over

11. And thats CLI use's objective: 
allow everyone to ship 
TRUE AI-native applications.
